# Getting Set Up

For this tutorial, you will need the following:

1. Python 3.4
2. matplotlib
3. networkx
4. pandas
5. hiveplot
6. numpy

## Easiest way: Anaconda Distribution of Python

If you have the Anaconda distribution of Python installed, then follow this set of instructions.

1. `cd /path/to/your/directory`
1. `git clone https://github.com/ericmjl/network-analysis-made-simple.git`
2. `cd network-analysis-made-simple`
3. `conda env create -f environment.yml`

If you do not have the Anaconda distribution, I would highly recommend getting it. Check out @jakevdp's talk at SciPy2015 - it's time to switch over.
