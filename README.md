[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Network Analysis Made Simple! This is a tutorial designed to teach you the basic and practical aspects of graph theory. It has been presented at multiple conferences (PyCon, SciPy, PyData, and ODSC) in a variety of formats (ranging from 1.5 hr to 4 hour long workshops). The material is designed for a live tutorial presentation, with the code available for you to reference afterwards.

### Local Setup

For those of you who would like to get setup beforehand and keep a local copy of the repository on your machine, follow along here.

#### Easiest way: Anaconda Distribution of Python

If you have the Anaconda distribution of **Python 3** installed on a Unix-like machine (Linux, macOS, etc.), then run `make conda`, which wraps the commands below.

1. `$ conda env create -f environment.yml`
1. `$ source activate nams`
1. `$ python checkenv.py`

If you do not have the Anaconda distribution, I would highly recommend getting it for [Windows][2], [Mac][3] or [Linux][4]. It provides an isolated Python computing environment that will not interfere with your system Python installation, and comes with a very awesome package manager (`conda`) that makes installation of new packages a single `conda install pkgname` away.

If you're not using Python 3, then check out @jakevdp's talk at SciPy2015 to find out why!

#### Alternative to Anaconda: `pip install`

For those who do not have the capability of installing the Anaconda Python 3 distribution on their computers, please follow the instructions below.

Run `make venv`, which wraps up the commands below. Special thanks to @matt-land for putting this script together.

1. Create a virtual environment for this tutorial, so that the installed packages do not mess with your regular Python environment.
    2. `$ pip install virtualenv`
    3. `$ virtualenv network`
    4. `$ source network/bin/activate`
5. `$ pip install matplotlib networkx pandas hiveplot numpy jupyter`

Check your environment:

1. `$ python checkenv.py`

#### Manual Build

For this tutorial, you will need the following packages:

1. Python 3
2. `matplotlib`
3. `networkx`
4. `pandas`
5. `hiveplot` - `conda install -c conda-forge hiveplot` or `pip install hiveplot`.
1. `nxviz` - `conda install -c conda-forge nxviz`.  (This implements Circos plots; HivePlots are being migrated over.)
6. `numpy`
7. `scipy`
8. `jupyter`

Then, clone the repository locally.

1. `$ cd /path/to/your/directory`
1. Clone the repository to disk:
    1. `$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple.git`
1. `$ cd Network-Analysis-Made-Simple`


### Run the Jupyter Notebook

    $ jupyter notebook

Your browser will open to an index page where you can click on a notebook to run it. Test that everything runs fine by executing all of the cells in the Instructor versions of the notebooks.

# Teaching with this repository material

If you would like to teach with this repository material, we request only the following:

1. As far as possible, make a fork, not a new repository, but no hard restriction here.
2. Ping us in the Issues tracker [here][1].
3. Please provide proper attribution back to the original in the primary landing page of derivative work (this would usually imply the `README`) , with the following text:

> This material has been adapted from the tutorial Network Analysis Made Simple created by Eric J. Ma and Mridul Seth. The original material can be found at: https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/.

4. Please provide a lightweight overview of modifications to the original material documented in forked repository. (An example would be a plain text `HISTORY` file, or as a section in the forked README.)
5. Loop back to us if there are recordings - so that we can link to them in the original repository! We would like to feature on here your efforts teaching with the material.
