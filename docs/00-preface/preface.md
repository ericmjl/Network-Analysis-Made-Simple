Hey, thanks for picking up this e-Book.
We had a ton of fun making the material,
and we hope you have a ton of fun learning new things from it too.

Applied network analysis, and graph theory concepts,
are getting more and more relevant in our world.
Graph problems are abound.
Once you pick up how to use graphs in an applied setting,
you'll find your view of data problems change tremendously.
We hope this book can become part of your learning journey.

The act of purchasing this book means you've chosen to support us, the authors.
It means a ton to us, as this book is the culmination of 5 years
of learning and teaching applied network analysis
at conferences around the world.
The reason we went with LeanPub to publish this book is this:
For as long as we issue updates to the book,
you will also receive an updated copy of it.
And because the book is digital, it's easy for us to get updates out to you.

Just so you know, the full text of the book is available online too,
at the accompanying website, https://ericmjl.github.io/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple.
On there, you'll find a link to Binder so you can interact with the code,
and through the act of playing around with the code and breaking it yourself,
learn new things.
(Breaking code and fixing it is something you _should_ be doing -
it's one of the best ways to learn!)

If you have questions about the content,
or find an errata that you'd like to point out,
please head over to https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/,
and post an issue up there.
We'll be sure to address it and acknowledge it appropriately.

We hope that this book becomes a stepping stone in your learning journey.
Enjoy!

Eric & Mridul
