    "A\n",
    "B\n",
    "C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the nodes also had metadata.\n",

    "A, circle, 5\n",
    "B, circle, 7\n",
    "C, square, 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this look familiar to you?\n",
    "Yes, node sets can be stored in CSV format,\n",
    "with one of the columns being node ID,\n",
    "and the rest of the columns being metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge set as tables\n",
    "\n",
    "If, between the nodes, we had 4 edges (this is a directed graph),\n",
    "we can also represent those edges in plain text, computer-readable format:\n",

    "A, C, red\n",

    "\n",
