    If you remember, at the beginning of this book,
    we saw a quote from John Quackenbush that essentially said
    that the reason a graph is interesting is because of its edges.
    In this chapter, we'll see this in action once again,
    as we are going to figure out how to leverage the edges
    to find special _structures_ in a graph.

    ## Triangles

    The first structure that we are going to learn about is **triangles**.
    Triangles are super interesting!
    They are what one might consider to be
    "the simplest complex structure" in a graph.
    Triangles can also have semantically-rich meaning depending on the application.
    To borrow a bad example, love triangles in social networks are generally frowned upon,
    while on the other hand, when we connect two people that we know together,
    we instead _complete_ a triangle.

    ### Load Data

    To learn about triangles,
    we are going to leverage a physician trust network.
    Here's the data description:

    > This directed network captures innovation spread among 246 physicians
    > for towns in Illinois, Peoria, Bloomington, Quincy and Galesburg.
    > The data was collected in 1966.
    > A node represents a physician and an edge between two physicians
    > shows that the left physician told that the right physician is his friend
    > or that he turns to the right physician if he needs advice
    > or is interested in a discussion.
    > There always only exists one edge between two nodes
    > even if more than one of the listed conditions are true.

    ### $k$-Cliques

    Cliques are identified by their size $k$,

    A triangle is what we would consider to be a $k$-clique where $k=3$.

    A square with cross-diagonal connections is what we would consider to be
    a $k$-clique where $k=4$.

    By now, you should get the gist of the idea.
