Thank you for making it this far!
We hope you've enjoyed the book.
If you want to further your learning,
here's a few resources to keep you going.

<!--
## DataCamp

I have a course on DataCamp that you can use
to get further practice.
Signing up also supports me financially
(that's my disclaimer),
though the financial support also helps me make more
programmer-oriented data science content for you!
You can sign up at [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=883155-2f8036&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=ericma1)

Here's an overview of what's available

=== "Introduction"

    I created "Introduction to Network Analysis with Python" in 2017,
    and have been continually updating it with the latest API.
    It will give you complementary extra practice to the exercises in this book.

    You can find the course [here](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-network-analysis-in-python).

=== "Intermediate"

    This is the next step up from "Introduction to Network Analysis".
    You will explore some of the advanced topics in this book,
    with different exercises in there to help you reinforce the ideas.

    The link to this course is [here](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-network-analysis-in-python).

=== "Project"

    Mridul's project is up on DataCamp as a continuation of the series
    of network analysis courses.
    The online learning environment should help you with reinforcing
    the ideas in there.

    The link to his "project course" is [here](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/76).

## Academic Books

=== "Statistics"

    "Statistical Analysis of Network Data" is an incredible resource for learning
    how to analyze graph data from a statistical viewpoint.
    It is written by Boston University's professor of mathematics
    Eric D. Kolaczyck.
    I used it during graduate school
    as part of my personal learning journey.
    The book's website can be found [here](http://math.bu.edu/people/kolaczyk/SAND.html),
    and is available on Amazon (click on the book link below).

=== "Network Science"

    This is a book by Prof. Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, and is freely available [online].
    In it, he explores network analysis from the perspective of an applied academic discipline,
    showing universal properties and processes that underly networks.

=== "Think Complexity"

    This is a book by Prof. Allen Downey at the Olin College of Engineering.
    In fact, this was the first book that exposed me (Eric Ma)
    to network science and its ideas, which thus inspired my thesis topic,
    which then gave me the impetus to learn graph theory and make this tutorial.
    I hope it becomes a useful thing for you too.
    You can find the book [at Green Tea Press][thinkcomp] for free,
    but do consider purchasing a copy to support Allen's work!

=== "Spectral Graph Theory"

    This is a book by UCSD Prof. Fan Chung.
    It is being partially revised, with chapters available [online][fanchung].
    Contains valuable information on the connections between graphs and linear algebra.

## Online Resources

=== "Snacks"

    Snacks is a repository of network analysis learning tools
    curated in the same spirit as the "Awesome-X" repositories
    that show up on GitHub.
    You can find it [here](https://github.com/alonnir/snacks/).

## Interesting Papers

=== "Network Analysis"

    Here are some interesting papers that showcase the power of network analysis:

    - [Matrix-Weighted Networks for Modeling Multidimensional Dynamics: Theoretical Foundations and Applications to Network Coherence](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/jw1k-6s7w) - A comprehensive overview of network analysis techniques and applications.
