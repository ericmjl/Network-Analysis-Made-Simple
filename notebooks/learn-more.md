Thank you for making it this far!
We hope you've enjoyed the book.
If you want to further your learning,
here's a few resources to keep you going.

## DataCamp

I have a course on DataCamp that you can use
to get further practice.
Signing up also supports me financially
(that's my disclaimer),
though the financial support also helps me make more
programmer-oriented data science content for you!
You can sign up at [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=883155-2f8036&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=ericma1)

Here's an overview of what's available

=== "Introduction"

    I created "Introduction to Network Analysis with Python" in 2017,
    and have been continually updating it with the latest API.
    It will give you complementary extra practice to the exercises in this book.

    You can find the course [here](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-network-analysis-in-python).

=== "Intermediate"

    This is the next step up from "Introduction to Network Analysis".
    You will explore some of the advanced topics in this book,
    with different exercises in there to help you reinforce the ideas.

    The link to this course is [here](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-network-analysis-in-python).

=== "Project"

    Mridul's project is up on DataCamp as a continuation of the series
    of network analysis courses.
    The online learning environment should help you with reinforcing
    the ideas in there.

    The link to his "project course" is [here](https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/76).

## Academic Books

=== "Statistics"

    "Statistical Analysis of Network Data" is an incredible resource for learning
    how to analyze graph data from a statistical viewpoint.
    It is written by Boston University's professor of mathematics
    Eric D. Kolaczyck.
    I used it during graduate school
    as part of my personnal learning journey.
    The book's website can be found [here]
    (http://math.bu.edu/people/kolaczyk/SAND.html),
    and is available on Amazon (click on the book link below).
