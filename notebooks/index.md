Hey, thanks for stopping by!

Network Analysis Made Simple is a collection of Jupyter notebooks
designed to help you get up and running with the NetworkX package
in the Python programming langauge.
It's written by programmers for programmers,
and will give you a basic introduction to
graph theory, applied network science,
and advanced topics to help kickstart your learning journey.
There's even case studies to help those of you
for whom example narratives help a ton!

We hope you enjoy learning from it.

## Introduction Videos

At the beginning of each "chapter",
there's an introduction video just like the one you'll see embedded below.
Those videos will give you an overview of the chapter,
particularly what to look out for and what the learning goals are,
and are designed to orient you on the right path.
If you're not the audio/visual kind,
feel free to skip past them :).
Because they're hosted on YouTube,
if you need captions,
hit the captions button to get access to them.
