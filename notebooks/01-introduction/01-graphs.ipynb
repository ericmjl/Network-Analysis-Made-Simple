    "helps us refine our application of networks.\n",
    "So bear with me for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the slightly more academic literature,\n",
    "networks are more formally referred to as **graphs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are comprised of two _sets_ of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **node set**: the \"entities\" in a graph.\n",
    "- An **edge set**: the record of \"relationships\" between the entities in the graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$n = \\{a, b, c, d, ...\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the **edge set** $e$ would be represented as tuples of _pairs_ of elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e = \\{(a, b), (a, c), (c, d), ...\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you extracted every node from the edge set $e$,\n",
    "it should form _at least a subset_ of the node set $n$.\n",
    "(It is at least a subset because not every node in $n$ might participate in an edge.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you draw out a network, the \"nodes\" are commonly represented as shapes, such as circles,\n",
    "while the \"edges\" are the lines between the shapes."

    "Now that we have a proper definition of a graph,\n",

    "\n",
    "One example I (Eric Ma) am fond of, based on my background as a biologist,\n",
    "is a protein-protein interaction network.\n",
    "Here, the graph can be defined in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- nodes/entities are the proteins,\n",
    "- edges/relationships are defined as \"one protein is known to bind with another\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A more colloquial example of networks is an air transportation network.\n",
    "Here, the graph can be defined in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- nodes/entities are airports\n",
    "- edges/relationships are defined as \"at least one flight carrier flies between the airports\".\n",
    "\n",
    "And another even more relatable example would be our ever-prevalent social networks!\n",
    "With Twitter, the graph can be defined in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- nodes/entities are individual users\n",
    "- edges/relationships are defined as \"one user has decided to follow another\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've seen the framework for defining a graph,\n",

    "**What examples of networks have _you_ seen before in your profession?**\n",
