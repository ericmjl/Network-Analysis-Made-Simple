## Introduction

In order to get the most of this book,
you will want to be able to execute the examples in the notebooks,
modify them, break the code, and fix it.
Pedagogically, that is the best way for you to learn the concepts.
Here are the recommended ways in which you can get set up.

## Binder

We recommend the use of Binder!
This is because Binder will automagically setup
an isolated and ephemeral compute environment for you
with all of the packages needed to run the code in your notebooks.
As such, you won't have to wrestle with anything at the terminal.
To go there, click on the following button:

## VSCode Development Containers

Assuming that you're using Visual Studio Code
and have attempted to use development containers before,
you can run the Network Analysis Made Simple tutorial content
inside a development container.
After Binder, this is the second easiest way to get set up.
You need to have Docker installed on your computer
but don't worry -- you won't have to execute any Docker commands :).

### Install the Remote Containers extension

This is found in the Extensions marketplace.

### Clone the repository to your local drive

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple.git
```

### Open the repository in VSCode

Use `Cmd+Shift+P` (on macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (on Linux/Windows)
to open the command palette, and search for "Rebuild and Reopen in Container" as below:

Hit enter and wait for the container to build automagically. This may take around 10 minutes or so, depending on your system.

## `conda` environments

We also recommend the use of `conda` environments!
Use this if you're not already using one of the options above.
If you are feeling confident enough to set up
a conda environment at the terminal,
then follow along.
(We'll be assuming you've already cloned the repository locally.)

### Leverage the Makefile

We've provided a Makefile with a single command:

```bash
make conda
```

On most \*nix systems, that should get you most of the way
to having the environment setup.

### Alternative: Execute individual commands

If you encounter errors, then you should know that the Makefile command
`make conda`
basically wraps the following steps.

Firstly, it creates the conda environment based on the `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Next, it activates the environment:

```bash
conda activate nams
```

We have a custom module for the project, which is called `nams`,
that you will have to install.

```bash
# In the root directory of the cloned repository
python setup.py develop
```

Finally, it runs a check on the environment
to make sure everything is installed correctly:

```bash
python checkenv.py
```

## `venv` environments

If you're not a `conda` user, then you can use `venv` to create your environment.


### Leverage the Makefile

As with the `conda` commands, you should be able
to execute a single Makefile command at your terminal:

```bash
make venv
```

Special heartfelt thanks goes out to GitHub user @matt-land
who contributed the `venv` script.
