    In this chapter, We want to introduce you to the wonderful world of graph visualization.

    You probably have seen graphs that are visualized as hairballs.
    Apart from communicating how complex the graph is,
    hairballs don't really communicate much else.
    As such, my goal by the end of this chapter is
    to introduce you to what I call _rational graph visualization_.

    But before we can do that, let's first make sure we understand
    how to use NetworkX's drawing facilities to draw graphs to the screen.
    In a pinch, and for small graphs, it's very handy to have.

    A different way that we can visualize a graph is by visualizing it in its matrix form.
    The nodes are on the x- and y- axes, and a filled square represent an edge between the nodes.

    What can you tell from the graph visualization?
    A few things are immediately obvious:

    - The diagonal is empty: no student voted for themselves as their favourite.
    - The matrix is asymmetric about the diagonal: this is a directed graph!

    (An undirected graph would be symmetric about the diagonal.)

    You might go on to suggest that there is some clustering happening,
    but without applying a proper clustering algorithm on the adjacency matrix,
    we would be hard-pressed to know for sure.
    After all, we can simply re-order the node ordering along the axes

    ## Principles of Rational Graph Viz

    While I was implementing these visualizations in [`nxviz`](https://github.com/ericmjl/nxviz),
    I learned an important lesson in implementing graph visualizations in general:

    > To be most informative and communicative,
    > a graph visualization should first prioritize node placement
    > in a fashion that makes sense.

    In some ways, this makes a ton of sense.
    The nodes are the "entities" in a graph,
    corresponding to people, proteins, and ports.
    For "entities", we have natural ways to group, order and summarize (reduce).
    (An example of a "reduction" is counting the number of things.)
    Prioritizing node placement allows us
    to appeal to our audience's natural sense of grouping, ordering and reduction.

    So the next time you see a hairball,
    I hope you're able to critique it for what it doesn't communicate,
    and possibly use the same principle to design a better visualization!
