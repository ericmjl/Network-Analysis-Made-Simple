One way would be to take one node, and look at its neighbors.
If its neighbors are also connected to one another,

Another way would be to start at a given node,

If the starting node is the neighbor of the node two hops away,

I would suggest the following strategy:

1. Pick a node
1. For every pair of neighbors:
    1. If neighbors are not connected,
    then this is a potential triangle to close.

This strategy gives you potential triadic closures
given a "center" node `n`.

The other way is to trace out a path two degrees out
and ask whether the terminal node is a neighbor
of the starting node.
If not, then we have another triadic closure to make.
