How does the breadth-first search work?
It essentially is as follows:

1. Begin with a queue that has only one element in it: the starting node.
2. Add the neighbors of that node to the queue.
    1. If destination node is present in the queue, end.
    2. If destination node is not present, proceed.
3. For each node in the queue:
    1. Remove node from the queue.
    2. Add neighbors of the node to the queue. Check if destination node is present or not.
    3. If destination node is present, end. <!--Credit: @cavaunpeu for finding bug in pseudocode.-->
    4. If destination node is not present, continue.

    Special thanks to @ghirlekar for suggesting that we keep track of the
    "visited nodes" to prevent infinite loops from happening. This also
    removes the need to remove nodes from queue.

    Reference: https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/issues/3

    With thanks to @joshporter1 for the second bug fix. Originally there was
    an extraneous "if" statement that guaranteed that the "False" case would
    never be returned - because queue never changes in shape. Discovered at
    PyCon 2017.

    With thanks to @chendaniely for pointing out the extraneous "break".

    If you would like to see @dgerlanc's implementation, see
