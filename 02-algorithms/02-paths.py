    ## Graph traversal and node importance

    Graph traversal is akin to walking along the graph, node by node,
    constrained by the edges that connect the nodes.
    Graph traversal is particularly useful for understanding
    the local structure of certain portions of the graph
    and for finding paths that connect two nodes in the network.

    In this chapter, we are going to learn how to perform pathfinding in a graph,
    specifically by looking for _shortest paths_ via the _breadth-first search_ algorithm.
    Then, we are going to explore measures of node importance that are related to traversals on a graph!

    ## Breadth-First Search

    The BFS algorithm is a staple of computer science curricula,
    and for good reason:
    it teaches learners how to "think on" a graph,
    putting one in the position of
    "the dumb computer" that can't use a visual cortex to
    "_just know_" how to trace a path from one node to another.
    As a topic, learning how to do BFS
    additionally imparts algorithmic thinking to the learner.

    ### Exercise: Design the algorithm

    Try out this exercise to get some practice with algorithmic thinking.

    > 1. On a piece of paper, conjure up a graph that has 15-20 nodes. Connect them any way you like.
    > 1. Pick two nodes. Pretend that you're standing on one of the nodes, but you can't see any further beyond one neighbor away.
    > 1. Work out how you can find _a_ path from the node you're standing on to the other node, given that you can _only_ see nodes that are one neighbor away but have an infinitely good memory.

    If you are successful at designing the algorithm, you should get the answer below.

    ## Visualizing Paths

    One of the objectives of that exercise before was to help you "think on graphs".
    Now that you've learned how to do so, you might be wondering,
    "How do I visualize that path through the graph?"

    Well first off, if you inspect the `test_path_exists` function above,

    that you can use. Here's what using `nx.shortest_path()` looks like.

    As you can see, it returns the nodes along the shortest path,
    incidentally in the exact order that you would traverse.

    One thing to note, though!
    If there are multiple shortest paths from one node to another,
    NetworkX will only return one of them.

    So how do you draw those nodes _only_?

    You can use the `G.subgraph(nodes)`
    to return a new graph that only has nodes in `nodes`
    and only the edges that exist between them.
    After that, you can use any plotting library you like.
    We will show an example here that uses nxviz's matrix plot.

    You'll also notice that if you try to modify the graph `g`, say by adding a node:

    ```python
    g.add_node(2048)
    ```

    you will get an error:

    ```python

    From the perspective of semantics, this makes a ton of sense:
    the subgraph `g` is a perfect subset of the larger graph `G`,
    and should not be allowed to be modified
    unless the larger container graph is modified.

    ## Bottleneck nodes

    We're now going to revisit the concept of an "important node",
    this time now leveraging what we know about paths.

    In the "hubs" chapter, we saw how a node that is "important"
    could be so because it is connected to many other nodes.

    Paths give us an alternative definition.
    If we imagine that we have to pass a message on a graph
    from one node to another,
    then there may be "bottleneck" nodes
    for which if they are removed,
    then messages have a harder time flowing through the graph.

    One metric that measures this form of importance
    is the "betweenness centrality" metric.
    On a graph through which a generic "message" is flowing,
    a node with a high betweenness centrality
    is one that has a high proportion of shortest paths
    flowing through it.
    In other words, it behaves like a _bottleneck_.
