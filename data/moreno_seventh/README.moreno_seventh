Seventh graders network, part of the Koblenz Network Collection
===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the moreno_seventh network:

This directed network contains proximity ratings between studetns from 29 seventh grade students from a school in Victoria. Among other questions the students were asked to nominate their preferred classmates for three different activities. A node represents a student. An edge between two nodes shows that the left student picked the right student as his answer. The edge weights are between 1 and 3 and show how often the left student chose the right student as his favourite.


More information about the network is provided here:
http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/moreno_seventh

Files:
    meta.moreno_seventh -- Metadata about the network
    out.moreno_seventh -- The adjacency matrix of the network in space separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.moreno_seventh are:
        First column: ID of from node
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column: edge weight
    ent.moreno_seventh.student.gender -- Contains the attribute `gender` of entity `student` of the network
