long-description: This directed network contains proximity ratings between studetns from 29 seventh grade students from a school in Victoria. Among other questions the students were asked to nominate their preferred classmates for three different activities. A node represents a student. An edge between two nodes shows that the left student picked the right student as his answer. The edge weights are between 1 and 3 and show how often the left student chose the right student as his favourite.
