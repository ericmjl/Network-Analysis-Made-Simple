# About The resources Folder

You put resources like images in this folder.

Here's how you insert an image from the resources folder:

![Palm Trees](palm-trees.jpg)

You don't need to add a caption:

![](palm-trees.jpg)

To set a cover image, just name an image title_page.png or title_page.jpg and
put it in this folder. If there is no cover image, Leanpub will just make a
plain book cover with your book title and your name.

To learn more about how to size your images (including your cover image) based
on your book size, see:
Author > Books > (your book) > Settings > Image Sizing Help
