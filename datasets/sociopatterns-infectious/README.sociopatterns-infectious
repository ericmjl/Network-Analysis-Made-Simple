Infectious network, part of the Koblenz Network Collection
===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the sociopatterns-infectious network:

This network describes the face-to-face behavior of people during the exhibition INFECTIOUS: STAY AWAY in 2009 at the Science Gallery in Dublin. Nodes represent exhibition visitors; edges represent face-to-face contacts that were active for at least 20 seconds. Multiple edges between two nodes are possible and denote multiple contacts. The network contains the data from the day with the most interactions.


More information about the network is provided here: 
http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/sociopatterns-infectious

Files: 
    meta.sociopatterns-infectious -- Metadata about the network 
    out.sociopatterns-infectious -- The adjacency matrix of the network in space separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.sociopatterns-infectious are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column: edge weight
        Fourth column: timestamp of the edge


Complete documentation about the file format can be found in the KONECT
handbook, in the section File Formats, available at:
